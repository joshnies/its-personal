The standard for team communication in the remote workplace has morphed into
something far from natural, something _efficient_. In the pursuit of increased
‚Äúproductivity‚Äù, most companies rely on asynchronous chat apps like Slack and
Microsoft Teams for the majority of their team communication through channel,
group, and direct messaging. As a result, remote workers (hello üëã) experience a
social disconnect from their coworkers, which can lead to **devastating mental
health problems** such as anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Lesser known,
these negative mental health effects also effect organizations at a massive
scale: [according to the
HHS](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf),
loneliness is costing companies around $154,000,000,000 **every year.**

<br />

Yet, human communication is inherently inefficient. Our speech is filled with
_ums_ and _uhs_, emotionally-charged and synchronous by nature. **And
that‚Äôs a great thing.** It‚Äôs what a Slack message can never be: emotional,
lively. Human. The inefficiencies in natural conversation - the pauses, the
tangents, the shared laughter - are precisely what make it so valuable!

<br />

Moving workplace comms out of the physical office has removed this spontaneity from our day-to-day.
Impromptu cubical visits from a teammate about something so unnecessary can now feel so strangely
necessary. These seemingly inefficient moments can lead to creative breakthroughs, stronger team
bonds, and a more vibrant company culture.

<br />

It is absolutely critical to the health of the general public that we don't lose sight of the
importance of face-to-face interactions in fostering innovation and camaraderie within teams. The
spontaneous nature of these exchanges allows for the free flow of ideas and the development of
personal connections that are difficult, if not impossible, to replicate one-to-one in a purely
digital environment.
